# 2025_ia651_bartiromo
* Created the GitHub and started project - 03/25/2025
* Found and uploaded datasets to work on - 03/25/2025
* Had first project meeting - 03/26/2025
* Fixed issues with GitHub organization - 03/26/2025
* Pushed all datasets and fixes to the new GitHub repo - 03/26/2025
* Imported all necessary libraries - 04/15/2025
* Combined all datasets into one Dataframe - 04/15/2025
* Created helper functions to create Tensorflow models - 04/15/2025
* Tried to implement Tensorflow models as scikitlearn subclasses for GridSearchCV - 04/15/2025
* Ended up making it easier by implementing my own grid search and no subclass nonsense - 04/17/2025
* Went to office hours and fixed all bugs in code for making, fitting, predicting, and evaluating the model - 04/18/2025
* Converted the model from 25 input variables and 100 output variables to 2500 input variables and 100 output variables - 04/18/2025
* Optimized code to run what was originally a double for loop to train test split into a single for loop - 04/18/2025
* Started running a grid search with 6 different train test splits and 8 different neuron patterns - 04/18/2025
* The grid search finally stopped running, and I plan to leave some extraneous code to have it as a view - 04/19/2025
* Added comments and extra markdown - 04/19/2025
* Pushed and committed to GitHub now - 04/19/2025
